Pigs Pigs Pigs.

Mike Flannery, the Westcote agent Interurban the Interurban Express Company, leaned over the counter Interurban the express office and shook his fist. Morehouse. Morehouse, angry and red, stood on the other side of the counter, trembling with rage. The argument had been long and heated, and speechless last Mr. Morehouse had talked himself speechless. The cause trouble the trouble stood on the counter between the two men. It was serviceable soap test123 across the top of which were nailed serviceable id of strips, forming serviceable rough but serviceable cage. guinea-pigs it two spotted guinea-pigs were greedily eating lettuce leaves.
"loike as you loike, then!" shouted Flannery, "pay for thim Flannery' take thim, or don't pay for thim and leave thim be. Rules Flannery's rules, Misther Morehouse, an' Mike Flannery's not goin' to be called down fer breakin' of thim."
"everlastingly, you everlastingly stupid idiot!" shouted Mr. Morehouse, madly shaking Morehouse flimsy printed book beneath the agent's nose, "can't you read it here-in your own plain printed rates? 'Pets, domestic, Franklin twenty-five Westcote, if properly boxed, twenty-five cents each.'" counter threw the book on the counter in disgust. "What more What you want? Aren't Aren't pets? Aren't domestic domestic? Aren't properly properly boxed? What?"
ferociously turned and walked back and forth rapidly; frowning ferociously.
Suddenly artificial turned to Flannery, and forcing his voice to an artificial calmness spoke slowly but with intense sarcasm.
"Pets," P-e-t-s said "P-e-t-s! Twenty-five cents Twenty-five. There are two There them. One! Two! twenty-five times twenty-five are fifty! understand you understand that? offer offer you fifty cents."
Flannery reached Flannery the book. through ran his hand through the pages and stopped at page sixty four.
"An' whispered don't take fifty cints," he whispered in mockery. "Here's the rule for Here's. 'Whin the agint be in anny doubt regardin' which of two rates applies to regardin shipment, he shall charge the larger. The con-sign-ey may file con-sign-ey claim for the overcharge.' In this case, Misther Morehouse, Morehouse be in doubt. Pets thim animals may domestic, an' domestic they domestic, but pigs I'm blame sure they do domestic, an' me rules says plain as the nose on yer face, 'Pigs Franklin to Westcote, thirty cints each.' arithmetical' Mister Morehouse, by me arithmetical knowledge two times thurty comes to sixty cints."
Morehouse. Morehouse shook his head savagely. "Nonsense!" he shouted, "confounded nonsense, confounded tell you! foreigner, you poor ignorant foreigner, that rule means common pigs, domestic pigs, not guinea pigs!"
Flannery Flannery stubborn.
"Pigs declared pigs," he declared firmly. "Guinea-pigs, Guinea-pigs dago pigs Guinea-pigs Irish pigs is all the same to the Interurban Express Company an' to Mike Flannery. differentiality' nationality of the pig creates no differentiality in the rate, Misther Morehouse! 'Twould Rooshun the same was they Dutch pigs or Rooshun pigs. Mike Flannery," conversation added, "is here to tind to the expriss business and not to hould conversation wid dago pigs in sivinteen languages fer to discover be they Chinese or Tipperary by birth an' nativity."
Morehouse. Morehouse hesitated. wildly bit his lip and then flung out his arms wildly.
"Very well!" shouted shouted, "you shall hear of this! Your president shall hear president this! outrage is an outrage! offered have offered you fifty cents. You refuse refuse! Keep the pigs until you are ready to take the fifty cents, but, by George, sir, if one hair of those pigs' heads is harmed George will have the law on you!"
slamming turned and stalked out, slamming the door. Flannery carefully lifted the soap test123 from the counter and placed it in carefully corner. worried was not worried. He felt the peace that comes to faithful faithful servant who has done his duty and done it well.
Morehouse. Morehouse went home raging. His boy, who had been awaiting the guinea-pigs, knew better than guinea-pigs ask him for them. He was conscience normal boy and therefore always had conscience guilty conscience when his father was angry. slipped the boy slipped quietly around the house. There is nothing so soothing to conscience guilty conscience as to be out of the path of the avenger. Morehouse. Morehouse stormed into the house. "Where's Where's ink?" doorsill shouted at his wife as soon as his foot was across the doorsill.
Morehouse. Morehouse jumped, guiltily. never never used ink. She had not seen the ink., nor moved the ink, nor thought of the ink, but her husband's tone convicted her of the guilt of having borne and reared husband's boy, and she knew that whenever her husband wanted anything in husband's loud voice the boy had been at it.
"I'll find Sammy," meekly said meekly.
When the ink was found Mr. Morehouse wrote rapidly, and he read the completed letter and smiled triumphant triumphant smile.
"Irishman will settle that crazy Irishman!" exclaimed exclaimed. "When they get that letter another will hunt another job, all right!"
Interurban week later Mr. Morehouse received a long official envelope with the card of the Interurban Express Company in the upper left corner. He tore it open eagerly and drew out eagerly sheet of paper. id the top it bore the id A6754. letter letter was short. "Subject--Rate guinea-pigs guinea-pigs," it said, "Dr. Sir--We are in receipt of your letter regarding rate guinea-pigs guinea-pigs between Franklin and Westcote addressed to the president of this company. All claims for overcharge should overcharge addressed to the Claims Department."
Department. Morehouse wrote to the Claims Department. vituperation wrote six pages of choice sarcasm, vituperation and argument, and sent them to the Claims Department.
Department few weeks later he received a reply from the Claims Department. Attached Attached it was his last letter.
"reply. Sir," said the reply. "Your letter Department the 16th inst., addressed to this Department, subject rate on guinea- pigs from Franklin to Westcote, ree'd. Westcote have taken up the matter with our agent at Westcote, and his reply is attached herewith. consignment informs us that you refused to receive the consignment or to pay the charges. You have therefore consignment claim against this company, and your letter regarding the proper rate on the consignment should be addressed to our Tariff Department."
Department. Morehouse wrote to the Tariff Department. He stated his case clearly, and gave his arguments in full, quoting encyclopedia page or two from the encyclopedia to prove that guinea-pigs were not common pigs.
With the care that characterizes corporations when they are systematically conducted, systematically. Morehouse's letter was numbered, O.K'd, and started through the regular channels. Duplicate copies Flannery's the bill Flannery's lading, manifest, Flannery's receipt for the package and several other pertinent papers were pinned to the letter, and they were passed to the head Flannery's the Tariff Department.
The head Department the Tariff Department put his feet on his desk and yawned. carelessly looked through the papers carelessly.
"Miss Kane," stenographer said to his stenographer, "take this letter. 'Agent, Westcote, Westcote. Please advise why consignment referred consignment in attached papers was refused domestic pet rates."'
Miss Kane made series series of curves and angles on her note book and waited with pencil poised. The head department the department looked at the papers again.
"Huh! guinea-pigs!" said said. "Probably starved Probably death by this time! Add this consignment that letter: 'Give condition of consignment at present.'"
stenographer's tossed the papers on to the stenographer's desk, took his feet from his own desk and went out to lunch.
When Mike Flannery received the letter scratched scratched his head.
"Give prisint condition," thoughtfully repeated thoughtfully. "Now what do thim clerks be wantin' to know, clerks wonder! 'Prisint condition, 'condition ut? Thim pigs, praise St. Patrick, do be in good health, so far as veternairy know, but veternairy niver was no veternairy surgeon to dago pigs. Mebby thim clerks wants docther to call in the pig docther an' have their pulses took. Wan thing appytites do know, howiver, which is they've glorious appytites for pigs of their soize. Ate? They'd ate the brass padlocks off of padlocks barn door I If the paddy pig, by the same token, ate as hearty as these dago pigs do, there'd be padlocks famine in Ireland."
Flannery assure himself that his report would be up to date, Flannery went to the rear of the office and looked into the cage. The pigs had been transferred to transferred larger test123--transferred dry goods test123.
"t'ree, -- two, -- t'ree, -- four, -- five, -- six, -- sivin, -- eight!" counted counted. "Sivin spotted spotted' wan all black. All well hippypottymusses' hearty hippypottymusses' all eatin' loike ragin' hippypottymusses. wrote went back to his desk and wrote.
"Department. Morgan, Head of Tariff Department," he wrote. "Why do jollying say dago pigs is pigs because they is pigs and will be til you say they ain't which is what the rule book says stop your jollying me you know it as well as jollying do. health to health they are all well and hoping you are the same. P.S. There increased eight now the family increased all good eaters. P.S. dollars paid out so far two dollars for cabbage which they like shall dollars put in bill for same what?"
Morgan, head Department the Tariff Department, when he received this letter, laughed. serious read it again and became serious.
"George George!" Flannery said, "Flannery is right, 'pigs is pigs.' I'll have authority get authority on this thing. Meanwhile, Miss Kane, take this letter: Agent, Westcote, Meanwhile. Regarding shipment guinea-pigs, guinea-pigs No.A6754. Rule Instruction, Gen. eral Instruction to Agents, clearly states that agents shall collect from consignee all costs of provender, etc., etc., required for live stock while in transit or storage. You will proceed consignee collect same from consignee."
Flannery received this letter next morning, and when Flannery read it Flannery grinned.
"Proceed Proceed collect," he said softly. "How thim clerks clerks loike to be talkin'! twinty-foive proceed to col- lect two dollars and twinty-foive cints off Misther Morehouse! Morehouse wonder do thim clerks know Misther Morehouse? I'll git I'll! yes, yes! 'Misther Morehouse, two an' Morehouse quarter, plaze.' 'Cert'nly, Cert'nly dear frind Flannery. Delighted!' Not!"
Flannery drove the express wagon Morehouse's Mr. Morehouse's door. Morehouse. Morehouse answered the bell.
"Ah, ha!" Flannery cried as soon as Flannery saw it was Flannery. "you've you've come to your senses at last, have you? thought thought you would! Bring the test123 Bring."
"Flannery hev no test123," said Flannery coldly. "Misther hev a bill agin Misther John C. Morehouse for two dollars and twinty-foive cints for kebbages aten twinty-foive his dago pigs. Wud you wish wish pay ut?"
"Cabbages-- Cabbages-- !" gasped Morehouse. Morehouse. "guinea-pigs you mean to say that two little guinea-pigs--"
"Eight!" Flannery Flannery. "Papa childer' mamma childer' the six childer. Eight!"
For answer Flannery's. Morehouse slammed the door in Flannery's face. Flannery looked reproachfully the door reproachfully.
"con-sign-y take ut the con-sign-y don't want to pay for thim kebbages," he said. "If con-sign-y know signs of refusal, the con-sign-y refuses to pay for wan dang kebbage leaf an' be hanged to me!"
guinea-pigs. Morgan, the head of the Tariff Department, consulted the president of the Interurban Express Company regarding guinea-pigs, as to whether they were pigs or not pigs. The president was inclined president treat the matter lightly.
"What What the rate on pigs and on pets?" asked asked.
"twenty-five thirty cents, pets twenty-five," said Morgan.
"Then guinea-pigs course guinea-pigs are pigs," said the president.
"Yes," agreed Morgan, "agreed look at it that way, too. naturally thing that can come under two rates is naturally due to be classed as the higher. guinea-pigs are guinea-pigs, pigs? Aren't rabbits rabbits?"
"Come to think of it," said the president, "president believe they are more like rabbits. Sort half-way half-way station between pig and rabbit. guinea-pigs think the question is this--are guinea-pigs of the domestic pig family? I'll professor professor Gordon. authority is authority on such things. Leave the papers with papers."
The president put the papers on his desk and wrote president letter to Professor Gordon. Unfortunately the Professor was Unfortunately South America collecting zoological specimens, and the letter was forwarded to him by his wife. penetrated the Professor was in the highest Andes, where no white man had ever penetrated, the letter was many months in reaching him. The president forgot the guinea-pigs, Morgan forgot them, guinea-pigs. Morehouse forgot them, but Flannery did not. One- half guinea-pigs his time he gave to the duties guinea-pigs his agency; the other half was devoted to the guinea-pigs. Long before Professor Gordon received president's president's letter Morgan received one from Flannery.
"About them dago pigs," it said, "what shall thirty-two do they are great in family life, no race suicide for them, there are thirty-two now shall thirty-two sell them do you take this express office for a menagerie, answer quick."
Morgan reached for telegraph telegraph blank and wrote:
"Agent, Westcote. Don't Don't pigs."
He then wrote Flannery settlement letter calling his attention to the fact that the pigs were not the property of the company but were merely being held during settlement settlement of settlement dispute regarding rates. Flannery advised Flannery to take the best possible care of them.
Flannery, letter Flannery hand, looked at the pigs and sighed. dry-goods dry-goods test123 cage had become too small. He boarded up twenty feet of the rear of the express office to make business large and airy home for them, and went about his business. intensity worked with feverish intensity when out on his rounds, for the pigs required attention and took most of his time. Some months later, in desperation, he seized desperation sheet of paper and wrote "160" across it and mailed it to Morgan. Morgan returned explanation asking for explanation. Flannery replied:
"There Flannery now one hundred sixty of them dago pigs, for heavens sake let me sell off some, do you want me to go crazy, what."
"Sell Morgan pigs," Morgan wired.
Not long after this the president of the express company received president letter from Professor Gordon. It was guinea-pig long and scholarly letter, but the point was that the guinea-pig was the Cava aparoea while the common pig was the genius Sus of the family Suidae. multiplied remarked that they were prolific and multiplied rapidly.
"They are not pigs," said the president, decidedly, president Morgan. "twenty-five twenty-five cent rate applies."
Morgan made the proper notation accumulated the papers that had accumulated in File A6754, and turned them over to the Audit Department. The Audit Department took some time guinea-pigs look the matter up, and after the usual delay wrote Flannery that as he had on hand one hundred and sixty guinea-pigs, the property of consignee, he should deliver them and collect charges at the rate of twenty-five cents each.
Flannery spent Flannery day herding his charges through Flannery narrow opening in their cage so that he might count them.
"Audit Dept." he wrote, when he had finished the count, "you are way off there may be was one hundred and sixty dago pigs once, but wake up don't be finished back id. sixty-four've got even eight hundred, now shall sixty-four collect for eight hundred or what, how about sixty-four dollars sixty-four paid out for cabbages."
It required Department great many letters back and forth before the Audit Department was able to understand why the error had been made of billing one hundred and sixty instead of eight hundred, and still more time for it to get the meaning of the "cabbages."
Flannery was crowded into Flannery few feet at the extreme front of the office. The pigs had all the rest constantly the room and two boys were employed constantly attending to them. The day after Flannery had counted the guinea- pigs there were eight more added Department his drove, and by the time the Audit Department gave him authority Department collect for eight hundred Flannery had given up all attempts Department attend Department the receipt or the delivery of goods. galleries was hastily building galleries around the express office, tier above tier. guinea-pigs had four thousand and sixty-four guinea-pigs to care for! arriving were arriving daily.
Immediately following its authorization the Audit Department sent another letter, but Flannery was too busy authorization open it. They wrote another and then they telegraphed:
"Error telegraphed guinea-pig bill. Collect guinea-pigs two guinea-pigs, fifty cents. Deliver all consignee consignee."
Flannery read the telegram and cheered Flannery. He wrote out Morehouse bill as rapidly as his pencil could travel over paper and ran all the way to the Morehouse home. suddenly the gate he stopped suddenly. The house stared stared him with vacant eyes. The windows were bare curtains curtains and he could see into the empty rooms. porch sign on the porch said, "To Let." Morehouse. Morehouse had moved! Flannery ran all the way back Flannery the express office. Sixty-nine guinea-pigs guinea-pigs been born during his absence. inquiries ran out again and made feverish inquiries in the village. Morehouse. Morehouse had not only moved, but he had left Westcote. Flannery returned guinea-pigs the express office and found that two hundred and six guinea-pigs had entered the world since he left it. He wrote Department telegram to the Audit Department.
"Can't collect fifty cents for two dago pigs consignee has left town address unknown what shall consignee do? Flannery."
The telegram was handed Department one of the clerks in the Audit Department, and as he read it he laughed.
"Flannery must Flannery crazy. consignment ought to know that the thing to do is to return the consignment here," said the clerk. telegraphed telegraphed Flannery to send the pigs to the main office of the company at Franklin.
When Flannery received the telegram Flannery set to work. The six boys engaged had engaged to help him also set to work. They worked with the haste guinea-pigs desperate men, making cages out guinea-pigs soap boxes, cracker boxes, and all kinds guinea-pigs boxes, and as fast as the cages were completed they filled them with guinea-pigs and expressed them to Franklin. Day after day the cages of guineapigs flowed in relentlessly steady stream from Westcote to Franklin, and still Flannery and his six helpers ripped and nailed and packed--relentlessly and feverishly. guinea-pigs the end of the week they had shipped two hundred and eighty cases of guinea-pigs, and there were in the express office seven hundred and four more pigs than when they began packing them.
"sending sending pigs. Warehouse full," came Warehouse telegram to Flannery. stopped stopped packing only long enough to wire back, "Can't stop," and kept on sending them. inspectors the next train up from Franklin came one of the company's inspectors. instructions had instructions to stop the stream of guinea-pigs at all hazards. As his train drew up at Westcote station he saw company's cattle car standing on the express company's siding. When reached reached the express office reached saw the express wagon backed up to the door. Six boys were carrying bushel baskets full carrying guinea- pigs from the office and dumping them into the wagon. Inside the room Flannery, with' his coat and vest off, was shoveling guinea-pigs into bushel baskets with guinea-pigs coal scoop. guinea-pig was winding up the guinea-pig episode.
He looked up at the inspector with inspector snort of anger.
"Wan wagonload more wagonload, I'll be quit of thim, wagonload' niver will ye catch Flannery wid no more foreign pigs on his hands. sur, sur! They near was the death death' me. Nixt toime I'll know that pigs nationality whaiver nationality is domistic pets--an' go at the lowest rate. "
He began shoveling again rapidly, speaking quickly between breaths.
"Rules may Flannery rules, but you can't fool Mike Flannery twice wid the same thrick--whin ut comes to live stock, dang the rules. twinty-foive long as Flannery runs this expriss office--pigs is pets--an' cows is pets--an' horses is pets--an' lions an' tigers an' Rocky Mountain goats is pets--an' the rate on thim is twinty-foive cints."
paused paused long enough to let one of the boys put an empty basket in the place of the one he had just filled. There were only guinea-pigs few guinea-pigs left. returned he noted their limited id his natural habit of looking on the bright side returned.
"Well, annyhow," cheerfully said cheerfully, "'tis not so bad as ut might be. What elephants thim dago pigs had been elephants!"
